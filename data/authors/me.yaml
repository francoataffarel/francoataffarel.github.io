location: "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"

bio: >
  I’m an Offensive Security Engineer driven by a deep curiosity about how systems break — and how they’re defended. With over 5 years of experience in Red Team operations, penetration testing, adversary emulation, and vulnerability research across cloud, hybrid, and on-premise environments, applying real-world TTPs in fast-moving contexts.


  I hold the OSCE³ (OSWE, OSEP, OSED) certification, with a hands-on focus on exploitation, secure code review, and custom tooling. My master’s research explored large-scale IoT and embedded systems security, leading to multiple 0-days and CVEs and shaping how I approach practical security.

  When I’m not breaking or building systems, I’m usually studying new attack surfaces, refining techniques, and thinking about how to make security teams harder to surprise.
